# Project Description


# Assist Capacity Exchange Development

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project developing a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing towards sustainable, community-based capacity-building within the Wikimedia Movement. It intends to deliver an interactive, online platform, backed by a database, which will allow wikimedians to: publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups; conduct searches and access information published by others; connect with peers for knowledge exchange. The platform is intended to be responsive, intuitive, and accessible to all wikimedia users.

Originally built upon the OERWorldMap, the new development phase (2023-2025) is currently migrating the pilot software from Java to Python, using the Django framework. Therefore, the code is being reworked and re-written to embody a new pilot.
Within this effort, the intern will assist the project software developer on tasks related to planned Django Apps and other functionalities, such as the login, profile and search systems.

This project is mentored by Andi Inácio (Project Manager), Veronica Stocco (Software Developer), and Jan-Bart de Vreede (Advisory Committee member).

We strongly encourage the application of women, people of color, LGBTQIAP+, and/or Global Southerners . Being part of the wikimedia movement is an advantage perk.

 Outreachy mentors will often be in the community public chat. The project mentor's usernames are: ,

# Who will I work with?
 Each Outreachy intern works remotely with one or more mentors. Most Outreachy mentors only work with one intern per round. Mentors are your guides in learning more about free and open source software, technical and non-technical skills, and will always be there when you get stuck.

 During this internship project, you'll be interacting with a team of 3-5 people. The project has been accepting contributions from people from around the world for 0-2 months.

 You'll be working with the following mentor:

 Andi Inácio
 Personal info:

 Pronouns: she/her/hers
 Timezone: America/Sao Paulo
 Contact info:

 Personal email: "Andi Inácio" <andi.inacio@wmnobrasil.org>
 Each Outreachy mentor will have a different mentorship style, a preferred way to contact them, and different ways of working with interns. Andi Inácio's mentorship style is: During onboarding, I prefer periodic short meetings, standups, and reports. As the work progresses, informal reports. Communication can be established through the most suitable way for the intern.

 Outreachy mentors are required to be experienced contributors to free and open source software (FOSS). Andi Inácio has contributed to this team for 3-5 months. This mentor has made the following contributions to this team or other FOSS communities: As project manager, I connect technical development and outreach areas.

 The mentor has not provided their username on the FOSS community communication channel.

# How do I get help?
 The community members and the project mentor(s) are your guides to introduce you to the project community and contribution norms. Mentors are here to help answer your questions, encourage you, and help you when you get stuck.

 You should try to ask your questions on public project channels before asking mentors or coordinators questions privately. Often you'll get an answer faster if you ask on the public communication channels, rather than waiting for a mentor to answer your email. Applicants often have the same questions, so asking them in a public place helps other people.

 Try to make your questions concrete "I'm having trouble installing X and I've tried Y but I get Z error message". If you are having trouble figuring out how to make a contribution, please state where you looked for contribution tasks. For example, "I'm trying to make a contribution to X project. I looked in the Y repository for issues marked newcomer-friendly, but they all seem to be claimed by other Outreachy applicants. Can you point me to an issue that involves Z?"

 When you've exhausted all other avenues of communication, you can reach out to the community's coordinator. Each FOSS community has one or more coordinators. The Wikimedia coordinator(s) are "Onyinyechi Onifade" <oonifade@wikimedia.org>, "Sheila W." <swkaruku@gmail.com>

 If you're having trouble reaching both the mentors and the coordinators, you can contact the Outreachy mentors mailing list.
